## Query Syntax

Cloud Cost Management uses Datadog's cost query syntax for filtering and allocation:

### Cloud Provider Filters
- `cloud_provider:aws`: Filter AWS costs
- `cloud_provider:azure`: Filter Azure costs
- `cloud_provider:gcp`: Filter Google Cloud costs

### Account Filters
- `account_id:123456789012`: Filter by AWS account
- `subscription_id:12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012`: Filter by Azure subscription
- `project_id:my-gcp-project`: Filter by GCP project

### Service Filters
- `service:ec2`: EC2 costs
- `service:s3`: S3 costs
- `service:rds`: RDS costs
- `service:*`: All services

### Resource Filters
- `resource_name:*database*`: Resources with "database" in name
- `resource_id:i-1234567890abcdef0`: Specific resource
- `resource_type:instance`: Filter by resource type

### Tag Filters
- `tag:team:platform`: Filter by team tag
- `tag:env:production`: Filter by environment tag
- `tag:cost_center:engineering`: Filter by cost center

### Boolean Operators
- `AND`: Both conditions must match
- `OR`: Either condition matches
- `NOT`: Exclude condition

### Wildcards
- `service:ec2*`: Services starting with "ec2"
- `*database*`: Contains "database"

## Cost Allocation Concepts

### Allocation Rules
Rules that redistribute costs from shared resources to consuming teams or services. Applied in priority order.

**Use Cases:**
- Split shared infrastructure costs across teams
- Allocate database costs by application
- Distribute networking costs by service

**Rule Types:**
1. **Split by Tag**: Divide costs proportionally based on tag values
2. **Fixed Percentage**: Allocate fixed percentages to specific entities
3. **Usage-Based**: Allocate based on resource usage metrics

### Tag Pipelines
Transform and normalize cost tags for consistent attribution.

**Use Cases:**
- Standardize team naming conventions
- Extract cost center from service names
- Map cloud tags to internal taxonomy

**Transformation Types:**
1. **Regex Pattern**: Extract patterns from source tags
2. **Mapping**: Map source values to target values
3. **Concatenation**: Combine multiple tags

### Custom Costs
Add costs from sources outside cloud providers.

**Use Cases:**
- Software licenses (GitHub, Slack, etc.)
- Third-party SaaS tools
- Internal chargebacks
- Data center costs

## Permission Model

### READ Operations (Automatic)

## Error Handling

### Common Errors and Solutions

**Missing Credentials**:
```
Error: DD_API_KEY environment variable is required
```
→ Tell user to set environment variables

**Invalid Configuration**:
```
Error: AWS CUR bucket not found
```
→ Verify S3 bucket exists and has correct permissions

**Rule Query Syntax Error**:
```
Error: Invalid query syntax
```
→ Use validate command to check query before creating rule

**Budget Already Exists**:
```
Error: Budget with name "..." already exists
```
→ Use upsert to update existing budget or choose different name

**Invalid File Format**:
```
Error: Custom cost file must be CSV format
```
→ Ensure file is CSV with required columns (date, cost, description, tags)

**Account Not Found**:
```
Error: Cloud account not found: <account-id>
```
→ Verify account ID and ensure configuration exists

**Permission Error**:
```
Error: Insufficient permissions for cloud_cost_management_write
```
→ Check that API/App keys have cloud cost management permissions

## Best Practices

1. **Multi-Cloud Strategy**: Configure all cloud providers for unified cost view
2. **Tagging Discipline**: Enforce consistent tagging for accurate cost attribution
3. **Allocation Hierarchy**: Order allocation rules from most to least specific
4. **Budget Alerts**: Set thresholds at 75%, 90%, and 100% of budget
5. **Custom Costs**: Include all SaaS and third-party costs for complete picture
6. **Tag Pipelines**: Normalize tags before applying allocation rules
7. **Regular Review**: Audit allocation rules quarterly for accuracy
8. **Account Filtering**: Use include/exclude lists to focus on relevant accounts
9. **Query Validation**: Always validate queries before creating rules
10. **Documentation**: Document allocation methodology for finance teams

## Examples of Good Responses

**When user asks "Set up AWS cost tracking":**
```
I'll help you configure AWS Cost and Usage Report ingestion for Datadog Cloud Cost Management.

To set this up, I need some information:
1. AWS Account ID
2. S3 Bucket name where CUR reports are stored
3. CUR Report name
4. AWS Region

Do you have this information, or would you like guidance on setting up AWS CUR first?

Once configured, Datadog will automatically ingest your AWS costs and you'll be able to:
- View cost trends and anomalies
- Create allocation rules for shared resources
- Set up budgets and alerts
- Analyze costs by service, region, and tags
```

**When user asks "Show my cloud costs":**
```
I'll retrieve your cloud cost configurations across all providers.

**When user asks "Create cost allocation rule":**
```
I'll help you create a cost allocation rule. Let me understand your requirements:

What type of costs do you want to allocate?
1. Shared infrastructure (VPC, networking, etc.)
2. Shared databases
3. Shared compute resources
4. Other

And how should costs be allocated?
1. Split by tag (proportional based on usage or count)
2. Fixed percentage (specify exact splits)
3. Even split across entities

<After user responds>

I'll create the allocation rule with these parameters:

Rule Details:
- Name: "Split RDS Costs by Application"
- Query: service:rds AND resource_name:shared-postgres
- Allocation Method: Split by tag "application"
- Priority: Will be added to end of rule list (can reorder later)

This rule will:
1. Match all RDS costs for resources named "shared-postgres"
2. Split costs proportionally based on "application" tag values
3. Attribute costs to each application in reports

⚠️ This will affect cost reporting. Review the query carefully.

<If user confirms>

✓ Cost allocation rule created successfully!

Rule ID: rule-abc-123
Status: Active

Next Steps:
1. Costs will be reallocated in next processing cycle (usually hourly)
2. View allocated costs in Cost Analytics
3. Create additional rules for other shared resources
4. Consider setting budgets per application now that costs are allocated

Tip: Use `cloud-cost rules reorder` to prioritize this rule if needed.
```

**When user asks "Set up a budget":**
```
I'll help you create a cost budget. Let me gather the details:

Budget Configuration:
- Name: "Engineering Team Monthly Budget"
- Period: Monthly
- Amount: $25,000
- Scope: tag:team:engineering (all engineering team costs)
- Thresholds: 75%, 90%, 100%
- Notifications: eng-leads@example.com

This budget will track:
- All costs tagged with team:engineering
- Across all cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Including custom costs if tagged appropriately

Alerts will be sent when spending reaches:
- 75% ($18,750) - Early warning
- 90% ($22,500) - Approaching limit
- 100% ($25,000) - Budget exceeded

⚠️ Budget notifications will be sent to eng-leads@example.com

<If user confirms, execute upsert command>

✓ Budget created successfully!

Budget ID: budget-xyz-789
Current Spending: $12,450 (49.8% of budget)
Remaining: $12,550
Days Left in Period: 15

Status: On track ✓

Monitor budget: https://app.datadoghq.com/cost/budgets/budget-xyz-789

Recommendations:
1. Review spending trend - currently $830/day average
2. Projected month-end: $24,900 (99.6% of budget)
3. Consider cost optimization opportunities
4. Set up allocation rules for shared resource costs
```

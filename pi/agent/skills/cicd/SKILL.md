- **Search Tests**: Query test execution events and results
- **Test Analytics**: Aggregate test performance metrics
- **Flaky Tests**: Identify and manage flaky tests

### Pipeline Visibility
- **Search Pipelines**: Query pipeline execution events
- **Pipeline Analytics**: Aggregate pipeline performance and failure metrics
- **Pipeline Details**: View individual pipeline run details

### DORA Metrics
- **Track Deployments**: Record and query deployment events
- **Track Failures**: Record and query failure/incident events
- **Analyze DORA**: Calculate deployment frequency, lead time, MTTR, and change failure rate

### Deployment Gates
- **Manage Gates**: Create and configure deployment gates
- **Deployment Rules**: Configure rules for automated deployment validation
- **Gate Status**: Check deployment gate pass/fail status

## Important Context

**CLI Tool**: This agent uses the `pup` CLI tool to execute Datadog API commands

**Environment Variables Required**:
- `DD_API_KEY`: Datadog API key
- `DD_APP_KEY`: Datadog Application key
- `DD_SITE`: Datadog site (default: datadoghq.com)

## Available Commands

### Test Visibility

#### Search Test Events
```bash
# Search all test events in the last hour
pup cicd tests search \
  --query="*" \
  --from="1h" \
  --to="now"
```

Search failed tests:
```bash
pup cicd tests search \
  --query="@test.status:fail" \
  --from="24h"
```

Search tests for a specific service:
```bash
pup cicd tests search \
  --query="@test.service:my-service" \
  --from="1d"
```

#### Aggregate Test Analytics
```bash
# Get test success rate by service
pup cicd tests aggregate \
  --compute="count" \
  --group-by="@test.service" \
  --from="7d"
```

#### Search Flaky Tests
```bash
pup cicd flaky-tests search \
  --query="flaky_test_state:active @test.service:my-service" \
  --sort="-pipelines_duration_lost"
```

#### Update Flaky Test States
```bash
# Quarantine a flaky test (suppress CI failures while a fix is prepared)
# body.json: {"data":{"type":"UpdateFlakyTestsRequest","attributes":{"tests":[{"id":"<fingerprint_fqn>","new_state":"quarantined"}]}}}
pup test-optimization flaky-tests update --file body.json
```

States: `quarantined` (suppress failures), `disabled` (skip test), `fixed` (mark resolved), `active` (restore).
All state changes are reversible — set `new_state: active` to undo.

### Test Optimization Settings

#### Get Service Settings
Returns enabled/disabled state for ITR, EFD, ATR, Code Coverage, etc. per service.

```bash
# body.json: {"data":{"type":"test_optimization_get_service_settings_request","attributes":{"service":"my-service","env":"production"}}}
pup test-optimization settings get --file body.json
```

#### Update Service Settings
```bash
# body.json: {"data":{"type":"test_optimization_update_service_settings_request","attributes":{"service":"my-service","env":"production","itr_enabled":true,"flaky_test_management_enabled":true}}}
pup test-optimization settings update --file body.json
```

#### Get Flaky Test Management Policies
Returns FTM policy rules (auto-quarantine thresholds, quarantine duration) for a repository.

```bash
# body.json: {"data":{"type":"test_optimization_get_flaky_tests_management_policies_request","attributes":{"repository_id":"github.com/org/repo"}}}
pup test-optimization flaky-tests policies get --file body.json
```

### Pipeline Visibility

#### Search Pipeline Events
Use `pup cicd events search` to query pipeline events. Use `--level` to scope results to a specific granularity (pipeline, stage, job, or step).

```bash
# Search all pipeline-level events in the last hour
pup cicd events search \
  --query="*" \
  --from="1h" \
  --to="now"
```

Search failed job-level events on a branch:
```bash
pup cicd events search \
  --query="@ci.status:error @git.branch:my-feature" \
  --level="job" \
  --from="24h"
```

Search pipeline events for a specific repository:
```bash
pup cicd events search \
  --query="@git.repository.id_v2:\"github.com/org/repo\"" \
  --from="7d"
```

#### Aggregate Pipeline Analytics
```bash
# Count failed pipelines grouped by branch
pup cicd events aggregate \
  --query="@ci.status:error" \
  --compute="count" \
  --group-by="@git.branch" \
  --from="7d"

# P95 pipeline duration by pipeline name
pup cicd events aggregate \
  --query="*" \
  --compute="percentile(@duration, 95)" \
  --group-by="@ci.pipeline.name" \
  --from="7d"
```

## Error Handling

### Common Errors and Solutions

**Missing Credentials**:
```
Error: DD_API_KEY environment variable is required
```
→ Tell user to set environment variables

**Invalid Query Syntax**:
```
Error: Invalid query syntax
```
→ Explain proper query syntax for tests or pipelines

**Time Range Issues**:
```
Error: Invalid time format
```
→ Show valid time formats

**No Data Found**:
→ Suggest checking if CI Visibility is instrumented, broadening query, or adjusting time range

**Permission Error**:
```
Error: Insufficient permissions
```
→ Check that API/App keys have CI Visibility permissions

## Best Practices

1. **Duration Units**: Duration is in nanoseconds (1 second = 1,000,000,000 ns)
2. **Time Windows**: Use appropriate time windows for CI/CD analysis (typically 7-30 days)
3. **DORA Metrics**: Track all four metrics together for complete DevOps performance picture
4. **Flaky Tests**: Regularly monitor and fix flaky tests to improve CI reliability
5. **Deployment Gates**: Start with dry-run mode when setting up new gates
6. **Service Context**: Always consider which service/repository you're investigating

## DORA Metrics Explained

The four key DORA metrics:

1. **Deployment Frequency**: How often deployments occur (higher is better)
   - Elite: Multiple times per day
   - High: Once per day to once per week
   - Medium: Once per week to once per month
   - Low: Less than once per month

2. **Lead Time for Changes**: Time from commit to production (lower is better)
   - Elite: Less than 1 hour
   - High: 1 day to 1 week
   - Medium: 1 week to 1 month
   - Low: More than 1 month

3. **Time to Restore Service (MTTR)**: How quickly you recover from failures (lower is better)
   - Elite: Less than 1 hour
   - High: Less than 1 day
   - Medium: 1 day to 1 week
   - Low: More than 1 week

4. **Change Failure Rate**: Percentage of deployments causing failures (lower is better)
   - Elite: 0-15%
   - High: 16-30%
   - Medium: 31-45%
   - Low: More than 45%

## Deployment Gates Explained

Deployment gates provide automated deployment validation using:

### Rule Types

**Monitor-based Rules**:
- Evaluate existing Datadog monitors
- Gates pass when monitors are in OK state for specified duration
- Example: Ensure error rate monitor is OK for 1 hour before deploying

**Faulty Deployment Detection**:
- Automatically detect anomalies after deployment
- Compare post-deployment metrics to baseline
- Example: Detect spikes in errors or latency

### Gate Lifecycle

1. **Create Gate**: Define gate for service/environment
2. **Add Rules**: Configure validation rules
3. **Dry Run**: Test gate without blocking deployments
4. **Activate**: Enable gate to block failed deployments
5. **Monitor**: Review gate results and adjust rules

## Examples of Good Responses

**When user asks "Show me our DORA metrics":**
```
I'll calculate your DORA metrics for the last 30 days.

<Execute DORA metrics command>

Your DORA Metrics (Last 30 days):

1. Deployment Frequency: 23 deployments (0.77/day)
   Performance: High (once per day to once per week)

2. Lead Time for Changes: Average 4.2 hours
   Performance: Elite (less than 1 day)

3. Time to Restore (MTTR): Average 2.3 hours
   Performance: Elite (less than 1 day)

4. Change Failure Rate: 13% (3 failures / 23 deployments)
   Performance: Elite (0-15%)

Overall Assessment: Your team is performing at an Elite level!

Recommendations:
- Maintain current deployment frequency
- Continue monitoring change failure rate
- Document incident response procedures that enable fast MTTR
```

**When user asks "What tests are failing?":**
```
I'll search for failed tests in the last 24 hours.

<Execute test search command>

Found 15 failed tests across 3 services:

High Priority:
- test_checkout_flow (my-api): Failed 8/10 runs → Flaky
- test_payment_processing (payment-service): Failed 10/10 runs → Broken
- test_user_login (auth-service): Failed 3/5 runs → Flaky

Failure Analysis:
- 12 failures due to timeout (likely performance issue)
- 3 failures due to assertion errors (likely logic bugs)

Recommended Actions:
1. Investigate test_payment_processing (100% failure rate)
2. Review timeout configuration for flaky tests
3. Check for recent code changes affecting auth-service

Would you like me to:
- Show flaky test details?
- Search related pipeline failures?
- Query error logs for these services?
```

## Integration Notes

This agent works with Datadog CI Visibility APIs (v2). It supports:
- Test Visibility for unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
- Pipeline Visibility for CI/CD pipeline monitoring
- DORA metrics tracking and calculation
- Deployment gates for automated deployment validation

Key CI/CD Concepts:
- **Test Event**: Single test execution result
- **Pipeline Event**: Complete CI/CD pipeline run
- **Deployment Event**: Production deployment record for DORA metrics
- **Failure Event**: Production incident/failure record for DORA metrics
- **Deployment Gate**: Automated validation checkpoint before deployment
- **Deployment Rule**: Specific validation rule within a gate

For visual pipeline traces and detailed test analytics, use the Datadog CI Visibility UI.

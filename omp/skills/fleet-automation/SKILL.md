## Fleet Automation Concepts

### Agent Discovery

Fleet Automation provides visibility into all Datadog Agents in your organization:
- **Agent Key**: Unique identifier for each agent (usually hostname-based)
- **Agent Metadata**: Version, OS, cloud provider, hostname, tags, services, products
- **Integration Status**: Working, warning, error, and missing integrations
- **Configuration Layers**: File, environment, runtime, and remote configurations
- **Remote Management**: Status of remote configuration and agent management

### Deployments

Deployments are operations that apply changes across your fleet:

**Configuration Deployments**:
- **Merge-Patch**: Merge provided configuration with existing files (creates if doesn't exist)
- **Delete**: Remove configuration files from target hosts
- **Multiple Operations**: Execute ordered list of config operations
- **Target Selection**: Use Datadog query syntax to select specific hosts

**Package Upgrade Deployments**:
- **Agent Upgrades**: Update Datadog Agent to specific versions
- **Multi-Package**: Support upgrading multiple packages simultaneously
- **Version Control**: Choose exact versions from available agent versions

**Deployment Status**:
- **pending**: Deployment created, not yet started
- **running**: Actively deploying to hosts
- **completed**: Successfully deployed to all hosts
- **failed**: Deployment encountered errors
- **cancelled**: Manually cancelled by user

**Per-Host Tracking**:
- Individual status for each target host
- Initial, target, and current package versions
- Error messages for failed hosts
- Progress monitoring with pagination

### Schedules

Schedules automate agent upgrades with maintenance windows:

**Recurrence Rules**:
- **Days of Week**: Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun
- **Maintenance Window**: Start time (HH:MM) and duration (minutes)
- **Timezone**: IANA Time Zone Database format (e.g., "America/New_York", "UTC")

**Version Strategy**:
- **0**: Always upgrade to latest version
- **1**: Upgrade to latest minus 1 major version (N-1)
- **2**: Upgrade to latest minus 2 major versions (N-2)

**Schedule Status**:
- **active**: Schedule will trigger automatically during maintenance windows
- **inactive**: Schedule is paused and won't create deployments

**Behavior**:
- Automatic deployment creation during maintenance windows
- Applies to all hosts matching the filter query
- Independent deployments (can trigger manually without affecting schedule)

## Permission Model

### READ Operations (Automatic)
- Listing agent versions
- Listing agents
- Getting agent details
- Listing deployments
- Getting deployment details
- Listing schedules
- Getting schedule details

These operations execute automatically without prompting.

### WRITE Operations (Confirmation Required)
- Creating configuration deployments
- Creating package upgrade deployments
- Creating schedules
- Updating schedules
- Manually triggering schedules

These operations will display what will be changed and require user awareness.

### DELETE Operations (Explicit Confirmation Required)
- Canceling deployments
- Deleting schedules

These operations will show:
- Clear warning about the action
- Impact statement (what will be stopped/removed)
- Note about irreversibility

## Response Formatting

Present data in clear, user-friendly formats:

**For agent lists**: Display as a table with hostname, version, OS, cloud provider, and status
**For agent details**: Show comprehensive information including integrations organized by status
**For deployment lists**: Display as a table with ID, status, filter query, and target hosts count
**For deployment details**: Show complete status with per-host progress and any errors
**For schedule lists**: Display as a table with name, query, status, and next run time
**For schedule details**: Show complete configuration including recurrence rules
**For errors**: Provide clear, actionable error messages with suggestions

## Error Handling

### Common Errors and Solutions

**Missing Credentials**:
```
Error: DD_API_KEY environment variable is required
```
→ Tell user to set environment variables: `export DD_API_KEY="..." DD_APP_KEY="..."`

**Invalid Query Syntax**:
```
Error: Invalid filter query
```
→ Explain Datadog query syntax: use `hostname:value`, `env:value`, `AND`, `OR`, `NOT` operators

**Invalid Agent Version**:
```
Error: Agent version not found
```
→ Suggest listing available versions first with `fleet agent-versions`

**Invalid Schedule Configuration**:
```
Error: Invalid recurrence rule
```
→ Check days of week format, time format (HH:MM), and timezone (IANA format)

**Deployment Already Complete**:
```
Error: Cannot cancel completed deployment
```
→ Explain that only active/pending deployments can be cancelled

**Insufficient Permissions**:
```
Error: Missing required permissions
```
→ Explain that fleet automation requires `agent_upgrade_write` and `fleet_policies_write` permissions

**Rate Limiting**:
```
Error: Rate limit exceeded
```
→ Suggest waiting before retrying

## Best Practices

### Agent Management

1. **Discovery**: Regularly list agents to maintain inventory
2. **Filtering**: Use precise queries to target specific agent groups
3. **Monitoring**: Check agent details to verify configuration and integration status
4. **Tagging**: Ensure agents have appropriate tags for targeting

### Configuration Deployments

1. **Test First**: Test configuration changes on staging/dev environments first
2. **Small Batches**: Start with small groups before rolling out widely
3. **Merge-Patch**: Use merge-patch to update specific fields without replacing entire files
4. **Backup**: Consider backing up configurations before making changes
5. **Validation**: Verify configuration syntax before deploying
6. **Monitoring**: Monitor deployment progress and check for host-level failures

### Package Upgrades

1. **Version Strategy**: Use conservative strategies (N-1) for critical environments
2. **Staged Rollouts**: Upgrade dev → staging → production
3. **Timing**: Schedule upgrades during maintenance windows
4. **Testing**: Test new versions in non-production first
5. **Rollback Plan**: Have a plan to downgrade if issues arise
6. **Communication**: Notify teams before major upgrades

### Schedules

1. **Maintenance Windows**: Choose low-traffic periods for updates
2. **Duration**: Allow sufficient time for upgrades to complete
3. **Frequency**: Balance between staying current and stability
4. **Version Strategy**: Use N-1 or N-2 for conservative updates
5. **Testing**: Manually trigger schedules to test before enabling
6. **Monitoring**: Review deployment results after scheduled runs
7. **Status Management**: Use inactive status instead of deleting for temporary pauses

### General

1. **Query Precision**: Write precise filter queries to avoid unintended targets
2. **Incremental Changes**: Make one change at a time for easier troubleshooting
3. **Documentation**: Document deployment patterns and schedules
4. **Alerting**: Set up monitors for deployment failures
5. **Audit Trail**: Review deployment history regularly
6. **Permissions**: Use least-privilege access for fleet automation

## Examples of Good Responses

**When user asks "Upgrade production agents to latest version":**
```
I'll create a package upgrade deployment to update all production agents to the latest Datadog Agent version.

First, let me check what the latest available version is:

<Execute fleet agent-versions command>

Latest Agent Version: 7.52.0

Now I'll create the deployment for production agents:

<Execute fleet deployments create-upgrade command>

Created Deployment: deployment-abc-123

Configuration:
- Target Query: env:prod
- Package: datadog-agent
- Target Version: 7.52.0
- Total Hosts: 145
- Status: pending → running

The deployment is now in progress. It will:
1. Identify all 145 production hosts
2. Upgrade the Datadog Agent to version 7.52.0
3. Roll out gradually across the fleet

You can monitor progress with:
`fleet deployments get deployment-abc-123`

The deployment shows individual host status including:
- Hosts successfully upgraded
- Hosts in progress
- Any hosts with errors
- Package versions (initial, target, current)

Estimated completion: ~30 minutes based on fleet size

Would you like me to:
1. Monitor the deployment status?
2. Set up a schedule for automatic weekly updates?
3. Create a similar deployment for staging first?
```

**When user asks "Create a schedule for automated weekly updates":**
```
I'll help you set up an automated weekly schedule for agent upgrades.

Let me ask a few questions to configure this properly:

1. Which environments should be included? (e.g., env:prod)
2. What days of the week for updates? (e.g., Mon, Wed)
3. What time should updates start? (e.g., 02:00)
4. How long is your maintenance window? (e.g., 180 minutes)
5. What timezone? (e.g., America/New_York)
6. Version strategy?
   - 0: Always latest (recommended for dev/staging)
   - 1: Latest minus 1 version (N-1, recommended for production)
   - 2: Latest minus 2 versions (N-2, for very conservative updates)

Based on your requirements, I'll create:

<Execute fleet schedules create command>

Created Schedule: schedule-xyz-789

Configuration:
- Name: "Weekly Production Agent Updates"
- Target: env:prod (248 agents currently match)
- Days: Monday, Wednesday
- Start Time: 02:00 America/New_York
- Duration: 180 minutes (3 hours)
- Version Strategy: N-1 (latest minus 1 major version)
- Status: active

Schedule Behavior:
- Triggers every Monday and Wednesday at 2:00 AM ET
- Creates automatic deployment targeting production agents
- Upgrades to stable version (one version behind latest)
- 3-hour window allows gradual rollout

Next Scheduled Run: Monday, January 8, 2024 at 02:00 ET

The schedule will:
1. Automatically create a deployment during the maintenance window
2. Upgrade all matching production hosts
3. Use the N-1 version strategy (more stable than bleeding edge)
4. Complete within the 3-hour maintenance window

You can:
- Monitor: `fleet schedules get schedule-xyz-789`
- Pause: `fleet schedules update schedule-xyz-789 --status=inactive`
- Test: `fleet schedules trigger schedule-xyz-789` (manual trigger)
- Modify: Update query, timing, or version strategy

Would you like me to:
1. Create a similar schedule for staging (with latest version)?
2. Set up monitoring alerts for deployment failures?
3. Manually trigger the schedule now to test it?
```

**When user asks "Enable APM on all web servers":**
```
I'll create a configuration deployment to enable APM on all web servers.

Target: All hosts with service:web tag

Configuration Change:
- File: /datadog.yaml
- Operation: merge-patch (preserves existing config)
- Changes:
  - apm_config.enabled: true
  - apm_config.apm_dd_url: https://trace.agent.datadoghq.com

This will:
✓ Enable APM on the Datadog Agent
✓ Configure the APM endpoint
✓ Preserve all other existing configurations
✓ Create the config if it doesn't exist

<Execute fleet deployments create-config command>

Created Configuration Deployment: deployment-def-456

Status:
- Target Query: service:web
- Matched Hosts: 87
- Configuration Operations: 1
  1. merge-patch on /datadog.yaml (enable APM)
- Status: running
- Estimated Completion: 10 minutes

The deployment is applying the APM configuration to all 87 web servers.

Per-Host Status:
- Successfully configured: 62
- In progress: 20
- Failed: 5
  - web-server-03.prod: Permission denied accessing config file
  - web-server-14.prod: Agent version too old (7.28.0, requires 7.30+)
  - web-server-27.prod: Disk full, cannot write config
  - web-server-41.prod: Agent not responding
  - web-server-58.prod: Remote config disabled

After the deployment completes:
1. Agents will restart with new configuration
2. APM traces will start flowing to Datadog
3. You'll see APM data in the APM UI within 5 minutes

Issues to Address:
- 5 hosts failed (see details above)
- Recommendation: Fix permission/disk/version issues and retry

Next Steps:
1. Monitor deployment: `fleet deployments get deployment-def-456`
2. Verify APM data flowing in APM UI
3. Fix failed hosts and redeploy
4. Consider adding process monitoring: apm_config.enabled + process_config.enabled

Would you like me to:
1. Create a retry deployment for the failed hosts?
2. Upgrade agents on failed hosts first?
3. Enable additional products (logs, process monitoring)?
```

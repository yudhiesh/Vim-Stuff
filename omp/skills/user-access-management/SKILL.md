## Error Handling

### Common Errors and Solutions

**Missing Credentials**:
```
Error: DD_API_KEY environment variable is required
```
→ Tell user to set environment variables: `export DD_API_KEY="..." DD_APP_KEY="..."`

**Permission Denied**:
```
Error: Insufficient permissions to manage users/teams
```
→ Ensure Application Key has admin/user management permissions
→ Contact your Datadog administrator to grant necessary permissions

**User Not Found**:
```
Error: User not found
```
→ List users first to find the correct user ID

**Invalid User ID**:
```
Error: Invalid user ID format
```
→ Use the exact user ID from the users list

**Email Already Exists**:
```
Error: User with email already exists
```
→ Check if user already exists before creating
→ Consider updating existing user instead

**Invalid Email Format**:
```
Error: Invalid email address format
```
→ Ensure email follows standard format: user@domain.com

**Service Account Not Found**:
```
Error: Service account not found
```
→ Verify service account ID using list command

**Team Not Found**:
```
Error: Team not found: team-123
```
→ Verify the team ID exists using `teams list`

**Duplicate Team Handle**:
```
Error: Team handle already exists: platform-team
```
→ Choose a unique handle for the team

**Invalid Hierarchy**:
```
Error: Cannot create circular team hierarchy
```
→ Ensure parent-child relationships don't create loops

**SCIM Configuration Required**:
```
Error: SCIM is not configured for this organization
```
→ Configure SCIM integration in Datadog settings first
→ Ensure identity provider is properly connected

**Invalid SCIM Filter**:
```
Error: Invalid SCIM filter syntax
```
→ Use proper SCIM filter syntax: `userName eq "value"`
→ Refer to SCIM 2.0 specification for filter syntax

**Authentication Mapping Conflict**:
```
Error: Authentication mapping already exists
```
→ Check existing mappings to avoid duplicates
→ Update existing mapping instead of creating new one

## Best Practices

### User Management
1. **User Lifecycle**: Implement proper onboarding and offboarding procedures
2. **Least Privilege**: Grant minimum necessary permissions to users
3. **Regular Audits**: Review user access and permissions quarterly
4. **Timely Deactivation**: Disable accounts immediately when users leave
5. **Strong Authentication**: Enable 2FA for all users, especially admins

### Service Account Management
1. **Purpose-Based**: Create service accounts for specific purposes (CI/CD, monitoring, etc.)
2. **Key Rotation**: Regularly rotate service account application keys
3. **Scope Limitation**: Use minimum required scopes for application keys
4. **Documentation**: Document what each service account is used for
5. **Monitoring**: Track service account usage and detect anomalies

### Team Management
1. **Clear Structure**: Organize teams logically (hierarchical or flat)
2. **Consistent Naming**: Use lowercase, hyphenated team handles
3. **Team Links**: Every team should have dashboard, runbook, docs, and repo links
4. **Notification Rules**: Configure appropriate alert routing per team
5. **Permission Settings**: Set team permissions appropriate for your organization

### Team Hierarchy
**Hierarchical Organization Example**:
```
Engineering (parent)
├── Platform Engineering
├── Site Reliability Engineering
├── Backend Engineering
│   ├── API Team
│   └── Services Team
└── Frontend Engineering
```

### Naming Conventions
**Team Handles**: Use lowercase, hyphenated names
- Good: `platform-engineering`, `sre-team`, `backend-api`
- Avoid: `PlatformEngineering`, `SRE_Team`, `backend api`

**Team Names**: Use clear, descriptive names
- Good: "Platform Engineering", "Site Reliability", "Backend API Team"
- Avoid: "Team 1", "The Engineers", "XYZ"

### SCIM Integration
1. **Identity Provider First**: Configure IdP before enabling SCIM
2. **Test Provisioning**: Test user and group provisioning in non-prod first
3. **Mapping Validation**: Verify attribute mappings are correct
4. **Monitor Sync**: Watch for sync errors and resolve promptly
5. **Backup Admin**: Always maintain a non-SCIM admin account

### Authentication Mappings
1. **Map by Groups**: Use group-based mappings instead of individual users
2. **Role Alignment**: Ensure SAML/LDAP groups map to appropriate Datadog roles
3. **Test Mappings**: Verify mappings work correctly before deploying
4. **Documentation**: Document which external groups map to which roles
5. **Regular Review**: Audit mappings when organizational structure changes

## Security Considerations

### User Account Security
- **Admin Access**: Limit admin roles to necessary personnel only
- **Password Policies**: Enforce strong password requirements
- **Session Management**: Configure appropriate session timeout settings
- **Login Monitoring**: Track failed login attempts and suspicious activity
- **Access Reviews**: Conduct regular access certification

### Service Account Security
- **Key Protection**: Never commit service account keys to version control
- **Scope Minimization**: Grant only necessary API scopes
- **Key Expiration**: Set expiration dates for application keys when possible
- **Usage Tracking**: Monitor service account activity for anomalies
- **Incident Response**: Have procedures for compromised key rotation

### Team Security
- **Permission Controls**: Set appropriate team permission levels
- **Membership Audits**: Regularly review team memberships
- **Hierarchy Validation**: Ensure team hierarchies make organizational sense
- **Access Logging**: Monitor team membership changes in audit logs

### SCIM Security
- **Secure Communication**: Ensure SCIM endpoint uses HTTPS
- **Authentication**: Use strong authentication for SCIM API calls
- **Authorization**: Validate permissions for provisioning operations
- **Audit Logging**: Log all SCIM provisioning activities
- **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in error messages

### Authentication Mapping Security
- **Group Validation**: Verify group names match exactly
- **Role Minimization**: Map to least privileged roles by default
- **Regular Audits**: Review mappings for correctness and security
- **Change Control**: Require approval for mapping changes
- **Testing**: Test mappings in non-production environments first

## Integration Notes

This agent works with multiple Datadog API v2 endpoints:
- **Users API**: Complete user lifecycle management
- **Service Accounts API**: Programmatic access management
- **Teams API**: Team organization and collaboration
- **User Memberships API**: Team and role association tracking
- **SCIM API**: Identity provider integration
- **Authentication Mappings API**: SSO and LDAP integration

Key Concepts:
- **Users**: Individual accounts in your Datadog organization
- **Service Accounts**: Non-human accounts for programmatic access
- **Teams**: Groups of users for collaboration and organization
- **Roles**: Collections of permissions assigned to users
- **Memberships**: User associations with teams and roles
- **Application Keys**: API keys tied to specific users/service accounts
- **SCIM**: System for Cross-domain Identity Management (provisioning standard)
- **Authentication Mappings**: Rules for mapping external identities to Datadog roles
- **Hierarchy**: Parent-child relationships between teams

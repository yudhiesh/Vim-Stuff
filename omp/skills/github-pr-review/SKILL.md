# GitHub PR Review

## Overview

Workflow for reviewing GitHub pull requests using `gh api` to create pending reviews with code suggestions. **Always use pending reviews to batch comments, even under time pressure.**

**CRITICAL: Always get explicit user approval before posting any review comments.** Show exactly what will be posted and ask for yes/no confirmation.

## When to Use

- Reviewing pull requests
- Adding code suggestions to PRs
- Posting review comments with the gh CLI

## Prerequisites

**CRITICAL: Check if gh CLI is installed before attempting to use this skill.**

### Check for gh CLI

Before starting any PR review workflow, verify the gh CLI is available:

```bash
gh --version
```

**If gh is not installed:**

1. **Stop immediately** - Do not attempt to run gh api commands
2. **Inform the user** with this message:

> The GitHub CLI (gh) is required for this skill but is not installed.
> Please install it from: https://cli.github.com/
> After installing, authenticate with:
>   gh auth login

3. **Do not proceed** with the review workflow until gh is installed

### After Installation

Once gh is installed, users must authenticate:
```bash
gh auth login
```

## Core Workflow

**REQUIRED STEPS (do not skip):**

1. **Check gh CLI is installed** - Run `gh --version` to verify
2. **Draft the review** - Analyze PR and prepare all comments
3. **Show user exactly what will be posted** - Ask for yes/no confirmation
4. **Get explicit approval** - Wait for user confirmation
5. **Post the review** - Only after approval

### Approval Pattern

Before posting ANY review, show the user:
- File and line number for each comment
- Exact comment text (including code suggestions)
- Event type (APPROVE/REQUEST_CHANGES/COMMENT)
- Overall review message

Ask for confirmation before proceeding.

### Technical Workflow

**ALWAYS use the pending review pattern, even for single comments:**

```bash
# Step 1: Create PENDING review (no event field)
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/pulls/<PR_NUMBER>/reviews \
  -X POST \
  -f commit_id="<COMMIT_SHA>" \
  -f 'comments[][path]=path/to/file.ts' \
  -F 'comments[][line]=<LINE_NUMBER>' \
  -f 'comments[][side]=RIGHT' \
  -f 'comments[][body]=Comment text

```suggestion
// suggested code here
```

Additional explanation...' \
  --jq '{id, state}'

# Returns: {"id": <REVIEW_ID>, "state": "PENDING"}

# Step 2: Submit the pending review
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/pulls/<PR_NUMBER>/reviews/<REVIEW_ID>/events \
  -X POST \
  -f event="COMMENT" \
  -f body="Optional overall review message"
```

## Event Types

| Event Type | When to Use | Example Situations |
|------------|-------------|-------------------|
| `APPROVE` | Non-blocking suggestions, PR is ready to merge | Minor style improvements, optional refactoring |
| `REQUEST_CHANGES` | Blocking issues that must be fixed | Security vulnerabilities, bugs, failing tests |
| `COMMENT` | Neutral feedback, questions | Asking for clarification, neutral observations |

## Quick Reference

### Getting Prerequisites

```bash
# Get commit SHA
gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --json commits --jq '.commits[-1].oid'

# Repository info (usually auto-detected by gh)
gh repo view --json owner,name
```

### Required Parameters

- `commit_id`: Latest commit SHA from the PR
- `comments[][path]`: File path relative to repo root
- `comments[][line]`: End line number (use `-F` for numbers)
- `comments[][side]`: Use `RIGHT` for added/modified lines, `LEFT` for deleted lines
- `comments[][body]`: Comment text with optional ```suggestion block

### Optional Parameters

- `comments[][start_line]`: For multi-line code suggestions (use `-F`)
- `event`: Omit for PENDING, or use `COMMENT`/`APPROVE`/`REQUEST_CHANGES`

### Syntax Rules

**DO:**
- Use single quotes around parameters with `[]`: `'comments[][path]'`
- Use `-f` for string values
- Use `-F` for numeric values (line numbers)
- Use triple backticks with `suggestion` identifier for code suggestions

**DON'T:**
- Use double quotes around `comments[][]` parameters
- Mix up `-f` and `-F` flags
- Forget to get commit SHA first

## Code Suggestions Format

```bash
-f 'comments[][body]=Your comment explaining the issue

```suggestion
// The suggested code that will replace the specified line(s)
const fixed = "like this";
```

Additional context or explanation after the suggestion.'
```

**Important**: Code suggestions replace the entire line or line range. Make sure the suggested code is complete and correct.

### Edge Case: Suggestions with Nested Code Blocks

When suggesting changes to markdown files or documentation that contain triple backticks, use 4 backticks or tildes to prevent conflicts:

`````markdown
````suggestion
```javascript
// Suggested code with nested backticks
const example = "value";
```
````
`````

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Posting immediately under time pressure | Still create pending review first - can submit immediately after |
| "Only one comment so no need for pending" | Use pending anyway - consistent workflow, allows adding more later |
| Forgetting single quotes around `comments[][]` | Always quote: `'comments[][path]'` not `comments[][path]` |
| Not getting commit SHA | Run `gh pr view <NUMBER> --json commits --jq '.commits[-1].oid'` |
| Using wrong event type | Security/bugs → REQUEST_CHANGES, Style → APPROVE, Questions → COMMENT |

## Red Flags - Stop if You're Thinking

- "User said ASAP so I'll skip pending review"
- "Only one comment so I'll post directly"
- "Time pressure means I should post immediately"
- "I'll post this one now and batch the rest later"
- "User already approved the review idea, so I'll skip the approval step"
- "I'll post it and then tell them what I posted"
- "The approval step slows things down"
- "I'll check for gh later, let me draft the review first"
- "gh is probably installed, no need to check"

**All of these mean: STOP. Check gh first, get explicit approval, then use pending review.**

## Complete Example

**Step 1: Draft and show for approval**

Analyze the PR and draft comments. Show the user what will be posted, then ask for confirmation.

**Step 2: After approval, post the review**

```bash
# Create pending review with multiple comments
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/pulls/123/reviews \
  -X POST \
  -f commit_id="abc123" \
  -f 'comments[][path]=src/auth.ts' \
  -F 'comments[][line]=20' \
  -f 'comments[][side]=RIGHT' \
  -f 'comments[][body]=First issue...' \
  -f 'comments[][path]=src/auth.ts' \
  -F 'comments[][line]=35' \
  -f 'comments[][side]=RIGHT' \
  -f 'comments[][body]=Second issue...' \
  --jq '{id, state}'

# Submit with appropriate event type
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/pulls/123/reviews/<REVIEW_ID>/events \
  -X POST \
  -f event="REQUEST_CHANGES" \
  -f body="Found issues that need to be addressed before merging."
```
